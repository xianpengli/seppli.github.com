## Current Research
 * Currently, I am learning how to control IGBT, but just the initial stage such as turn on and turn off. Control strategy will be the next step.
 * I was investigating the dielectric recovery phenomena of circuit breakers, which is a part of HVDC circuit breaker research project supported by the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China.
 * My principal supervisor is Professor Jiyan Zou and I am responsible for the analysis of post-arc current and current chop phenomena by simulations and conducting experiments.
